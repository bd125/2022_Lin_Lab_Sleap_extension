# Lin Lab Sleap Extension, TDT circuits and Matlab Code
 Sleap extension is for identity correction after tracking. TDT Circuit is for fiber photometry recording and optogenetic stimulation. Matlab code is used for analyzing data.

In the Sleap Extension:

-SLPtool.py: To assign identiftity of each mouse

-Instructions_for_SLPtool: It is a user guide of the SLPtool.

In folder TDT Circuits:
-lockin2_RZ5: To perform bilateral recording

-lockin_ChR2: To perform optogenetic stimulation

In folder Matlab Code:
-Extraction_dual_with_videos: To extract the data from TDT Tank.

-FPanalysis_overall: To plot the DA signals with behaviors from individual animal.

-PSTH_all_raw: To plot the average PSTH from all the animals

-timeShiftCorrlation: To calculate the correlation coefficients betweem 2 curves and calculate the average correlation curve from all animals

-dFMean: To calculate the averaged DA signals during indicated behaviors.
